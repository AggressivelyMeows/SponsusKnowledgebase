# Our cookie policy

Hello, Sponsus user! We've prepared this Cookie Policy to help you understand and feel more confident about the use of cookies, tracking pixels or similar technologies on our Services. We’ve put this Policy together as simply as we legally can, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. However, the full text wording is what is important/binding legally.

### ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

This is the Cookie Policy of Sponsus Organisation LTD, \(we will further call ourselves “Sponsus”\). We use technologies on our online and mobile services, in particular on sponsus.org & spns.us \(which we'll call the Services\) to collect information that helps us improve your online experience. We refer to these technologies, which include cookies, tracking pixels or similar technologies, collectively as “cookies.” This policy explains the different types of cookies used on the Services and how you can control them. By using the Services and viewing the cookie notice that appears together with the Sponsus services, you agree that we can store and access cookies as described in this policy. This is Sponsus’s “Cookie Policy”, which explains how we use website/online cookies and how you can control them.

### WHAT IS A COOKIE?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They are widely used in order to make websites or other online services work or to be better or more efficient. They can do this because websites and other online services can read and write these files, enabling them to recognise you and remember important information that will make your use of them more convenient \(e.g. by remembering your user preferences\). Cookies are small text files stored on your device, which help to make websites/online services work and do this more efficiently.

### WHAT COOKIES ARE USED ON OUR SERVICES?

Below we list the different types of cookies we and our service providers may use on the Services. In this section we list the kinds of cookies we or our service providers use and what we use them for.

#### Essential Cookies.

These cookies are essential to the operation of our service in order to enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these cookies services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of a website or paid for content, cannot be provided. We also use cookies to help prevent fraudulent use of login credentials. These cookies are essential for using the Services and therefore cannot be turned off without severely affecting your use of it.

#### Performance Cookies.

Performance cookies, which often include analytics cookies, collect information about your use of this Services and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, performance cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our website, allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Services, help us record any difficulties you have with the Services and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. We also use cookies to help you navigate within our website and travel back to pages. ‘Performance cookies’ help us collect information about our services in order to improve them. 

#### Functionality Cookies.

In some circumstances, we may use functionality cookies. Functionality cookies allow us to remember the choices you make on the Services and to provide enhanced and more personalized features, such as customising a certain webpage, remembering if we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a profile. All of these features help us to improve your visit to the Services. In particular, Functionality Cookies on the Services include Preference Cookies which are placed to remember your preferences like language preferences. The maximum period after which these cookies expire is 12 months. ‘Functionality cookies’ help us to remember how you use our services, so that we can enhance and personalise them for you.

#### Analytics Cookies.

We use analytical tools such as Matomo or internal technologies to collect information about how visitors use our Services. For example, we can track different events like which Sponsus web pages or emails from us you actually opened and which links you clicked or analyse the traffic on our website. We use it to optimize our communications with you, to evaluate how our Services are being used, compile statistical reports on website activity and create a profile of aggregated visitors. On some of our pages we may use plugins from social media platform, such as “Like” button from Facebook. In such case your browser will send that social media platform information about the web page you visited, your IP address, and browser-related information. This occurs regardless of whether you clicked on the button or not. You can use content blocking solutions \(built-in in your browser or as a separate add-on\) to prevent loading such plugins. On some of our websites we may also use social media plugins such as “Like” button.

### HOW DO I CONTROL COOKIES?

Further information about the procedure to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. Also, some of our partners are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative \(“NAI”\) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance \(“DAA”\) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA's Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page. You will be still able to use our Services after disabling cookies, please be aware though that if all cookies are disabled, not all features of the Services may operate as intended. You can use your browser/device settings to control cookies at any time. Please note, that if you stop accepting all of the cookies, some features of our services may not operate at all.

Any amendments to this Cookie Policy will come into effect a reasonable period of time after this "LAST UPDATED" date \(normally we consider 30 days to be a reasonable time period\) unless you contact us before that date to discuss or query any of the amendments.
