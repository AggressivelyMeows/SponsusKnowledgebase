Writing posts that look good is as easy as pie with Sponsus. There are some small caveats that need to be addressed however as well as some notes on how to actually write the content. But once you finish this guide, you will be ready to rock on Sponsus!

## On the subject of images

Images on Sponsus are unique to some platforms as we have a few more features that other Markdown websites dont support. The first big note is that images look best when they are on their own line. This means seperating the image with empty lines above and below it. This means that the post will center and resize the image to look best on any device that views your wonderful post. An example of the recommended spacing:

```text
Honestly, dogs are pretty rad. Heres a dog pic:
